          Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
          all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
          arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
          most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
          back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called
          me Mr Glass.

          Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
          called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make
          shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
          going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
          television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
          of the ones that became nothing.
